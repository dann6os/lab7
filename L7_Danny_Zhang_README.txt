## Authors

* Danny Zhang (dn384827@dal.ca)


## Sources Used

* The styling in colour palette from the front end was taken from Lab 5 CSCI3172

* The grid structure code was interpreted and used from lab 3 CSCI3172

* Images of myself were from my own camera roll taken by myself. 

* Images used in Projects.jsx page were taken directly by myself screenshoting my group's project work. 

* The front end was copied over from the Lab 6 assignment, styles page was slightly modified to fit the additions required for Lab 7.


## Issues Encountered

* I had 404 errors that were eventually fixed by making sure the toml file had the proper redirects for the weather api and projects backend
* I had a 502 error for the weather api which didn't display the weather data properly, which needed
me to reinstall node-fetch to a previous version 
* Additionally I had to make sure the weather API key was properly placed as an environmental variable on netlify to make sure it worked.
